# OnlineBank
Beginner ASP.NET Core MVC Project

This is my first ASP.NET Core Web Project.  The OnlineBank in this project is way far away from real world online bank applications. However, this
project demonstrates my basic knowledge of C# programming language,  ASP.NET Core MVC framework.  

Skills demonstrated in this project:

1. Creating and adding data model, using entity framework
2. Using LINQ expressions in Controller methods,
3. Using Razor pages
4. Ability to configure Startup.cs class, adding ConnectionStrings in appsettings.json
5. Basic bootstrap library application.
6. Understanding Identity, creating Admin page.
7. Understanding Basic Http protocols,  Http Post and Get attributes.



P.S.  To access Admin page, please use the route: 'localhost:5000/Admin', Demo Account details: Login: Admin, Password: Secret123$
